    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the glue-jupyter package to explore Astronomical data for W5, which is a region in space where stars are currently forming. However, much of the functionality shown here would be applicable to other image and tabular datasets. In this notebook, we follow a similar analysis to that shown in the [Getting started](http://docs.glueviz.org/en/latest/getting_started/index.html) guide for the Qt-based glue application.\n",

The data can be found in https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-example-data/tree/master/Astronomy/W5.\n",
